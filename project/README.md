# tutorNET Web App - CS50 Final Project

tutorNET allow students to contact teachers anywhere. A teacher must provide basic info about himself, like name, photo, a little biography, phone number, subjects and work hours. Students may contact them through WhatsApp API on the application.

After registration, new teachers must fill out some basic information about themselves, or their profile will not be shown. The teacher info can be changed anytime thorugh the app profile settings, but at least one subject must be present.

The idea is to be a simple gap closer between people, so there is no built-in chat or email registration, any contact is made thorugh phone or WhatsApp.
