			<article>
				<p>
					Arch Linux is an independently developed, x86-64 general-purpose GNU/Linux
					distribution that strives to provide the latest stable versions of most software
					by following a rolling-release model. The default installation is a minimal base
					system, configured by the user to only add what is purposely required.
				</p>
			</article>

			<h2><strong>Core Principles</strong></h2>

			<div class="grid-container">
				<div class="info-box">
					<h2><strong>Simplicity</strong></h2>
					<p>
						Arch Linux defines simplicity as without unnecessary additions or
						modifications. It ships software as released by the original developers
						(upstream) with minimal distribution-specific (downstream) changes: patches
						not accepted by upstream are avoided, and Arch's downstream patches consist
						almost entirely of backported bug fixes that are obsoleted by the project's
						next release.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div class="info-box">
					<h2><strong>Modernity</strong></h2>
					<p>
						Arch Linux strives to maintain the latest stable release versions of its
						software as long as systemic package breakage can be reasonably avoided. It is
						based on a rolling-release system, which allows a one-time installation with
						continuous upgrades.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div class="info-box">
					<h2><strong>Pragmatism</strong></h2>
					<p>
						Arch is a pragmatic distribution rather than an ideological one. The
						principles here are only useful guidelines. Ultimately, design decisions are
						made on a case-by-case basis through developer consensus. Evidence-based
						technical analysis and debate are what matter, not politics or popular
						opinion.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div class="info-box">
					<h2><strong>User centrality</strong></h2>
					<p>
						Whereas many GNU/Linux distributions attempt to be more user-friendly, Arch
						Linux has always been, and shall always remain user-centric. The distribution
						is intended to fill the needs of those contributing to it, rather than trying
						to appeal to as many users as possible. It is targeted at the proficient
						GNU/Linux user, or anyone with a do-it-yourself attitude who is willing to
						read the documentation, and solve their own problems.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div class="info-box">
					<h2><strong>Versatility</strong></h2>
					<p>
						Arch Linux is a general-purpose distribution. Upon installation, only a
						command-line environment is provided: rather than tearing out unneeded and
						unwanted packages, the user is offered the ability to build a custom system by
						choosing among thousands of high-quality packages provided in the official
						repositories for the x86-64 architecture.
					</p>
